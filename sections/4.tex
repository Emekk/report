\subsection{Focusing on Long-Term Suppliers and Supplier Compliance}

\paragraph{} Nike decided to focus on long-term suppliers which invest capability and sustainability and share common values with Nike with a quality over quantity approach. For suppliers compliance, Nike periodically audited the suppliers and imposed sanctions in case of repeated violations.

\subsection{Building Supplier Capability}

\paragraph{} Nike aimed to enhance suppliers' production and management capabilities by improving working conditions and suppliers' sustainability. With \textbf{Lean 1.0}, Nike trained suppliers in lean manufacturing and decreased compliance violations by 15\%. With \textbf{Lean 2.0}, Nike focused on worker engagement, wihch increased quality and productivity, and decreased lead time and accidents.

\paragraph{} In our opinion, this action was spot on. Creating an environment where supplier factories and workers thrive to improve themselves aligns with both Nike's and suppliers' interests.
