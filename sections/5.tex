\section{Conclusion \& Recommendations}

\paragraph{} Considering the actions taken by Nike throughout the process, it can be observed that they are not sincere actions that directly addressing the ethical issues that was encountered in the past years (e.g Supply Chain improvements), but rather an attempt to improve their public image. Thus, those actions are not sufficient to put Nike in a better position with respect to the ethical issues.

\paragraph{} Our recommendation for Nike is to take more sincere actions to address the ethical issues, which can be achieved by putting the ethical issues as the top priority in the company's agenda, rather than regarding it as a trade-off between ethics and profits. An example of such action is to continue its sourcing from Asia despite the appeal of cheaper labor and shorter lead times in Carribbean and Central America, where corruption and labor issues are severe.
