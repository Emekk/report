\section{Ethical Issues Nike Faced}

\subsection{Labor Exploitation}

\paragraph{} Nike faced many ethical issues, such as substandard housing and child labor. Initially, Nike denied the responsibility with arguments such as, \enquote{\textit{It is not within Nikeâ€™s scope to investigate labor violations.}} and \enquote{\textit{It is subcontractor's fault}}. In our opinion, responding to such grave accusations with such statements is unethical and irresponsible. Nike should have taken responsibility and investigated the accusations, which they did later on.

\subsection{First Actions}

\paragraph{} After defending itself, the first action taken was to create a \textbf{Code of Conduct} which defines and regulates the working conditions of the supplier factories. Second one was to establish the \textbf{Corporate Social Responsibility} (CSR) department. Pros and cons of these actions are discussed in the table below.

\paragraph{} These actions were, however, not enough to solve the problem. Two main reasons for this were the lack of supplier collaboration and the cultural and legal differences between the countries.
